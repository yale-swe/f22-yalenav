# YaleNav

### 📱 A mobile app helping **yale** students explore and **navigate** campus seamlessly.

YaleNav only vertically-integrated navigation system that offers three features most critical to student life:

1. **A-to-B routing** with Yale-specific transport integration – you’ll finally know whether or not to wait for the shuttle.
2. **Dynamic visualization of campus spots** – you’ll know which butteries are near you and which dining halls are available.
3. Personalized tooling to help you **navigate your class schedule** faster than ever before.

👨‍💻 YaleNav's software architecture is a variation of [MERN](https://www.mongodb.com/mern-stack).

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) (Programming Language)
- [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) (Client-side Framework)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (Server-side Runtime)
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/) (Server-side Framework)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/home) (NoSQL Database)
- [Expo](https://expo.dev/) (Mobile App Platform)

## Quick start

Running this app locally requires the following technologies:

- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
- [Node v16.14](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/client)

## Directions

> **Note**: The following won't work without first installing the above!

Run `yarn install:all`. This will install all of the necessary npm packages.

Open a terminal window and run `yarn dev:env`. This will run a MongoDB container on your local machine. Keep this terminal open.

Open another terminal window and run `yarn dev:server`. This will run the REST API on port `4000`.

Open another terminal window. Run `yarn dev:client`. This will serve the client on port `3000` using Expo Go. From there you'll get to choose whether you'd like to run it on web, ios, or android. After completing the steps above, you should be able to go to `http://localhost:3000` on your browser and see the app.
