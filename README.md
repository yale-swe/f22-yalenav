# YaleNav

### üì± A mobile app helping **Yale** students explore and **navigate** campus seamlessly.

YaleNav is the only vertically-integrated navigation system that offers three features most critical to student life:

1. **A-to-B routing** with Yale-specific transport integration ‚Äì you‚Äôll finally know whether or not to wait for the shuttle.
2. **Dynamic visualization of campus spots** ‚Äì you‚Äôll know which colleges, libraries, and dining halls are near you.
3. Personalized tooling to help you **navigate your class schedule** faster than ever before.

üë®‚Äçüíª YaleNav's software architecture is a variation of [MERN](https://www.mongodb.com/mern-stack).

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) (Programming Language)
- [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) (Client-side Framework)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (Server-side Runtime)
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/) (Server-side Framework)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/home) (NoSQL Database)
- [Expo](https://expo.dev/) (Mobile App Platform)

## CI/CD

No one likes a broken app. We've configured [Github Actions](https://github.com/yale-swe/f22-yalenav/actions) to automatically run tests (linting, `server` tests ,and `client` tests) on every PR and every commit to main.

## Quick start ‚Äì 6 Step Set Up

Running this app locally requires the following technologies:

- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
- [Node v16.14](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/client)

> **Note**: The following won't work without first installing the above!

1. Clone the repo with `git clone https://github.com/yale-swe/f22-yalenav.git`

2. Run `yarn install:all` in the root directory (`f22-yalenav`). This will install all of the necessary npm packages.

3. In `client/src/constants.ts`, change the IP address from the default (DigitalOcean deployment IP) to your own. You can find your IP in [system preferences](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/8421538) (or, alternatively on Mac, hold `Ctrl + Option` and click on the WiFi icon at the top of your screen.) For an IP such as `123.45.789.0`, the `BACKEND` constant should look like this:

```
export const BACKEND = "http://123.45.789.0:4000";
```

4. Open a _first_ terminal window and run `yarn dev:env`. This will run a MongoDB container on your local machine. Keep this terminal open.

5. Open a _second_ (and final) terminal window and run `yarn dev:server`. This will run the REST API on port `4000`.

6. Open a _third_ (and final) terminal window. Run `yarn dev:client`. This will serve the client on your IP address (that's why we changed the `BACKEND` constant ‚òùÔ∏è) using [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/accounts/yalenav). From there, you'll have the option to run it on web, iOS, or Android simulators. Not that this app will only work on iOS and Android. **We recommend that you simply scan the QR code provided in the terminal and run the app straight on your phone**.

Completed all 6 steps? Your IDE (if you use one) should look something like this...
